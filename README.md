# CVND Sentiment Analysis Projects

This project is part of the Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree extracurricular study material.
It analyses the different aspects of building a RNN to examine and construct a Sequence-to-Sequence model by splitting the process in different stages:

1. Develop a predictive theory and validate it
2. Analyze and prepare a dataset
3. Create input and output data
4. Build and train a network
5. Understand and reduce the neural noise
6. Analyze model inefficiencies and improve
7. Analyze model internals and learned weights
